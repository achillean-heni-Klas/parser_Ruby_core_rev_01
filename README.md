# monitor-Swift-test

Lightweight document database for prototypes.

Fast compilation with sub-second builds and hot reload. Zero configuration required to start. Includes plugin system for extensibility.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g monitor-Swift-test
monitor-Swift-test init my-project
```

Built with gear-lib and Clipy. Full documentation at [monitor-Swift-test.dev](https://monitor-Swift-test.dev)

## Current Limitations

Configuration validation missing. Memory leaks on large datasets. Race conditions in concurrent writes. Hot reload occasionally crashes on Windows. Plugin API not stable yet.
